# Installation 
1) Once you have downloaded the code, run the following command
  a) npm i (create your own dotenv file for the connection.js to listen to)
2) login to mysql and then source db/schema.sql
3) use the command line by running the following command "npm start" (enter "npm run seed" in terminal for aleready seeded database.)

## Description
This is the Backend implementation for an e-commerce website which uses Express.js & Sequelize using the Mysql db.
Tested on Insomnia.
I had a backlog of challenges after hitting a bump on the road with mysql and this one, my main challenges were time management. this one made a lot of sense, and with a bit of practise I feel I would be able to understand this quicker and use it in real time.
A challenge I had was using the routes names and applyuing them in another file (and knowing what file to do this in; ie : change the name of something in the API, it needs to be updated in the models index also.) and the structure of the file. It was convenient that the file had a structured code, I may have found much more difficult if code was from scratch.


## preview 
I will be uploading a video playthrough for a preview during assignment submission.
